        <p>Morgan Bulkeley (1837–1922) was an American politician and business executive from Connecticut, who was, in 1876, the first president of baseball's National League. A Civil War veteran and the son of the first president of the Aetna Life Insurance Company, Bulkeley also led Aetna, from 1879 until his death. A Republican, he was from 1880 to 1888 mayor of Hartford, and starting in 1889 served as governor of Connecticut. He controversially remained in office for a second two-year term because the houses of the state legislature could not agree about the outcome of the 1890 election. A Democratic official locked a door in the State Capitol against him, and Bulkeley had it opened with a crowbar, thus becoming "the Crowbar Governor". He left office in 1893, and served as a U.S. senator from 1905 to 1911. After his death in 1922, a bridge and a high school were named for him. His induction in 1937 into the Baseball Hall of Fame remains controversial because his involvement in the game was brief. (Full article...)</p>
